## Design Direction

The design should feel warm, celebratory, and culturally rich while maintaining modern usability - evoking the joy and spiritual significance of Indian festivals through thoughtful use of traditional colors and contemporary interface patterns.

## Color Selection

Triadic (three equally spaced colors) - Using festival-inspired warm colors that represent the celebratory nature of Diwali (lights, gold) and Dussehra (victory, prosperity).

- **Primary Color**: Deep Orange (oklch(0.65 0.18 45)) - Represents the warm glow of diyas and festive celebrations
- **Secondary Colors**: Rich Purple (oklch(0.45 0.15 285)) for depth and Royal Gold (oklch(0.75 0.12 85)) for prosperity
- **Accent Color**: Warm Gold (oklch(0.8 0.15 75)) - Attention-grabbing highlight for CTAs and celebration elements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Cream White oklch(0.98 0.02 75)): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 13.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Pure White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 15.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Orange oklch(0.65 0.18 45)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Gold oklch(0.8 0.15 75)): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 8.7:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey celebration and clarity, using readable sans-serif fonts that work well for both English and potential Devanagari script support.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Quiz Titles): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Questions): Inter Medium/20px/relaxed spacing
  - Body (Answers/Content): Inter Regular/16px/normal spacing
  - Caption (Stats/Meta): Inter Regular/14px/wide spacing

## Animations

Subtle celebratory animations that enhance the festive feel without overwhelming the educational content - gentle transitions and micro-interactions that feel joyful and responsive.
